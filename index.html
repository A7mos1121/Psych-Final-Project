        <div class="Jean_Piaget">
            <div class="First_stage">
                First stage is “Sensorimotor stage” (Birth to 2 years)
                        In this stage, infants and toddlers primarily interact with the world through their sensory perceptions. For example, A child in this stage may engage in activities like peek-a-boo, where they enjoy the surprise of seeing a person reappear after a moment of disappearing.

            </div>
            <div class="Second_stage">
                Second stage is “Preoperational stage” (2 to 7 years)
                    In this stage, children begin to use symbols as a language to represent different object and ideas. For example, a child talking to their toys as they are real people that can talk and have feelings.

        </div>
        <div class="Third_stage">
                Third stage is “Concrete operational stage” (7 to 11 years)
                    In this stage, children start to think logically about concrete events and objects. For example, if you pour liquid from a tall, thin glass into a short, wide glass, a child in this stage understands that that amount of liquid remains the same despite the change in appearance.

        </div>
        <div class="Fourth_stage">
                Fourth stage is “Formal Operational stage” (11 years and older)
                    In this stage, adolescents and adults can think abstractly and engage in hypothetical reasoning. For example, A person in this stage might engage in abstract thinking by contemplating philosophical questions or using algebraic equations.

    <section id="Learning strategies to help a person memorize information">
        <h3> Learning strategies to help a person memorize information: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong> Active recall: </strong> It involves actively retrieving information from memory rather than simply reviewing it passively. This can be done through techniques such as flashcards or self-quizzing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Visualization and Mnemonics: </strong> It involves creating mental images to represent information. It is the action of using the brain to visualize a piece of information to help the person remember it or make any connections later.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Chunking: </strong> It involves breaking down large amounts of information into smaller, manageable parts. It is the action of organizing information into meaningful groups or categories. This strategy leverages the brain's ability to better process and remember information when it is organized into meaningful patterns or groups.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section id="Theories of personality">
        <h3> Theories of personality: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong> Psychoanalytic theory (Sigmund Freud): </strong> It is one of the earliest theories about personality. He proposed that personality is shaped by unconscious forces. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Trait theory (Gordon Allport): </strong> It focuses on identifying and measuring the stable and enduring patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion that make up an individual's personality.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section id="Strategies to reduce stress">
        <h3> Strategies to reduce stress: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong> Mindfulness Meditation: </strong> It is a practice that involves bringing one's attention to the present moment without judgement. It originates from Buddhist traditions but has been widely adopted in secular contexts for stress reduction. It allows thoughts to come and go without getting attached to them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> <abbr title="Progressive Muscle Relaxation"> PMR</abbr>: </strong> It is a technique that involves systematically tensing and then relaxing different muscle groups in the body. It helps release physical tension and promotes a sense of relaxation. It helps reduce muscle tension, lower blood pressure, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and stress.
